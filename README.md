# React Chat with socket io

As you can see, there are 2 separate directories. One is the client part, build with **React**.
The second is the server part in node js (with **express**).

### Front
- `cd` into the *client* directory
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start` => will do `react-scripts start`

### Back
- `cd` into the *server* directory
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start` => will do `node index.js`


Then browse to localhost:3000 to use the app.
